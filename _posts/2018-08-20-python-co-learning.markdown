This is a work group of python learners, meeting up every other week to continue learning on python.

As always there will be experienced Python Coaches around but we also just learn from each other.

You can just check the RSVP-List for people tagged "python coach" and feel free to contact any of them directly at the event.

This group is open to total beginners in programming, who want to learn python, as well as to people, who are further or just have specific questions and/or need help with python related topics.

Please don't forget to bring your own laptop.
