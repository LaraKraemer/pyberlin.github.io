Django User Group Berlin is a meetup community for anyone interested in Django or Python, whether you're just starting out or already an experienced developer.

Our group is for anyone curious to learn something new or simply looking to connect with others who work with a similar tech stack. No prior experience is needed; everyone’s welcome! Meetups are held every two months and conducted in English. As a bonus, there’s usually food and always drinks at the events.

We care all about being open, inclusive, and community-driven. If you have an idea for a talk or you want to collaborate as a host? We’d love to hear from you!
