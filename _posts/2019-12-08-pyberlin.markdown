PyBerlin is a meetup community for anyone interested in Python - at all levels, from complete beginners to seasoned professionals.

We'll keep the topics covered as broad as possible - professional development tools, making physical things, teaching kids to code, cutting edge data analytics, personal projects, and even having fun and being artistic with code.

We want to be open, inclusive, and very much about community - so please don't hesitate to suggest meetups, ideas and collaborating with others.
